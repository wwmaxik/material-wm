# material-wm

**material-wm** is a monolithic, all-in-one Desktop Environment (DE) and Wayland compositor combining the **Material You (crDroid-style) visual design** with the production-tested **Niri** Smithay architecture.

## Highlights
- **Native Material Top Bar:** 38px height, launcher grid button, dynamic workspace pills, active window title, unified status chip with Wi-Fi, battery % and clock.
- **crDroid-Style Quick Settings Drawer:** Fast drawer overlay featuring live clock/date, interactive capsule sliders for volume & brightness, 4 Material You quick tiles (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Night Light, Performance), and user footer card.
- **Material App Launcher:** Centered modal card with elevation drop shadows, darkened backdrop scrim, real-time `.desktop` search, category badges, keyboard navigation and tactile feedback.
- **Niri Foundation:** DRM/KMS, Udev, libinput handling, display hotplugging, XWayland clipboard sync, matrix-based damage-tracked rendering, 1:1 touchpad physics, and screencopy.
- **Optimized for Low-Power Hardware:** Fully compatible with Intel Pentium N3700 (Silvermont/Airmont architecture) without requiring AVX/AVX2 instructions. Matrix animations and damage tracking keep CPU & GPU usage minimal.

## About

Windows are arranged in columns on an infinite strip going to the right.
Opening a new window never causes existing windows to resize.

Every monitor has its own separate window strip.
Windows can never "overflow" onto an adjacent monitor.

Workspaces are dynamic and arranged vertically.
Every monitor has an independent set of workspaces, and there's always one empty workspace present all the way down.

The workspace arrangement is preserved across disconnecting and connecting monitors where it makes sense.
When a monitor disconnects, its workspaces will move to another monitor, but upon reconnection they will move back to the original monitor.

## Features

- Built from the ground up for scrollable tiling
- [Dynamic workspaces](https://niri-wm.github.io/niri/Workspaces.html) like in GNOME
- An [Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/379a5d1f-acdb-4c11-b36c-e85fd91f0995) that zooms out workspaces and windows
- Built-in screenshot UI
- Monitor and window screencasting through xdg-desktop-portal-gnome
    - You can [block out](https://niri-wm.github.io/niri/Configuration%3A-Window-Rules.html#block-out-from) sensitive windows from screencasts
    - [Dynamic cast target](https://niri-wm.github.io/niri/Screencasting.html#dynamic-screencast-target) that can change what it shows on the go
- [Touchpad](https://github.com/niri-wm/niri/assets/1794388/946a910e-9bec-4cd1-a923-4a9421707515) and [mouse](https://github.com/niri-wm/niri/assets/1794388/8464e65d-4bf2-44fa-8c8e-5883355bd000) gestures
- Group windows into [tabs](https://niri-wm.github.io/niri/Tabs.html)
- Configurable layout: gaps, borders, struts, window sizes
- [Gradient borders](https://niri-wm.github.io/niri/Configuration%3A-Layout.html#gradients) with Oklab and Oklch support
- [Background blur](https://niri-wm.github.io/niri/Window-Effects.html) for windows and layer-shell surfaces
- [Animations](https://github.com/niri-wm/niri/assets/1794388/ce178da2-af9e-4c51-876f-8709c241d95e) with support for [custom shaders](https://github.com/niri-wm/niri/assets/1794388/27a238d6-0a22-4692-b794-30dc7a626fad)
- Live-reloading config
- Works with [screen readers](https://niri-wm.github.io/niri/Accessibility.html)

## Status

Niri is stable for day-to-day use and does most things expected of a Wayland compositor.
Many people are daily-driving niri, and are happy to help in our [Matrix channel].

Give it a try!
Follow the instructions on the [Getting Started](https://niri-wm.github.io/niri/Getting-Started.html) page.
Grab a desktop shell like [DankMaterialShell] or [Noctalia] (or build a more traditional setup): niri by itself is not a complete desktop environment.
Also check out [awesome-niri], a list of niri-related links and projects.

Here are some points you may have questions about:

- **Multi-monitor**: yes, a core part of the design from the very start. Mixed DPI works.
- **Fractional scaling**: yes, plus all niri UI stays pixel-perfect.
- **NVIDIA**: seems to work fine.
- **Floating windows**: yes, starting from niri 25.01.
- **Input devices**: niri supports tablets, touchpads, and touchscreens.
You can map the tablet to a specific monitor, or use [OpenTabletDriver].
We have touchpad gestures, but no touchscreen gestures yet.
- **Wlr protocols**: yes, we have most of the important ones like layer-shell, gamma-control, screencopy.
You can check on [wayland.app](https://wayland.app) at the bottom of each protocol's page.
- **Performance**: while I run niri on beefy machines, I try to stay conscious of performance.
I've seen someone use it fine on an Eee PC 900 from 2008, of all things.
- **Xwayland**: [integrated](https://niri-wm.github.io/niri/Xwayland.html#using-xwayland-satellite) via xwayland-satellite starting from niri 25.08.

## Contributing

If you'd like to help with niri, there are plenty of both coding- and non-coding-related ways to do so.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/niri-wm/niri/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for an overview.

## Inspiration

Niri is heavily inspired by [PaperWM] which implements scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.

One of the reasons that prompted me to try writing my own compositor is being able to properly separate the monitors.
Being a GNOME Shell extension, PaperWM has to work against Shell's global window coordinate space to prevent windows from overflowing.

## Tile Scrollably Elsewhere

Here are some other projects which implement a similar workflow:

- [PaperWM]: scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.
- [karousel]: scrollable tiling on top of KDE.
- [scroll](https://github.com/dawsers/scroll) and [papersway]: scrollable tiling on top of sway/i3.
- Hyprland has a built-in [scrolling layout](https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Layouts/Scrolling-Layout/).
- [Paneru] and [PaperWM.spoon]: scrollable tiling on top of macOS.
